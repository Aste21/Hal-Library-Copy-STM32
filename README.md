# Hal-Library-Copy-STM32
A copy of fundamental functions from the HAL library like ReadPin, WritePin, GPIO_Init etc., in a library called ,,HULK". This library implements simple GPIO functions and simple TIM6 Counter. In main there is an example of a simple program that displays a 4 digit number, and changes it exactly every 1 second,  based on joystick.
